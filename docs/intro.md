### About Me

Hi there! I'm Felipe from **Vitória-ES** Brasil, currently **studying Computer Engineering at Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo**.

### Trajectory

Since high school, I have been captivated by Math and Physics, and my interest later expanded to include Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. Consequently, I opted to pursue Computer Engineering, envisioning it as a synthesis of both disciplines.

During my inaugural semester, I became an active member of a Junior Enterprise, where I engaged in Fullstack Web Development, utilizing Node.js and React with Typescript. However, after two years, I began to sense that my potential could be more effectively harnessed in a different realm, particularly within the domain of **Artificial Intelligence**.

And so, here I am, leveraging my perseverance and technical skills to immerse myself in this vast universe.

### Ambitions and Objectives

I aspire to acquire expertise in Convolutional Neural Networks for **Computer Vision**, dedicating myself to making a positive impact on the world through diligent effort.
